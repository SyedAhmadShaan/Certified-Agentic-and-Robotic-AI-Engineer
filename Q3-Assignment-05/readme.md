## Requirements

- **Google Colab:** This project is designed to be run in a Google Colab environment.
- **Google API Key:** You'll need a valid Google API key to access the Gemini API. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set it up.
- **Libraries:** The project uses the `google-genai` library, which will be installed automatically.

## Usage

1. **Open the notebook in Google Colab.**
2. **Install necessary libraries:** Execute the code cell for installing `google-genai`.
3. **Set up your Google API key:** Follow the instructions in the notebook to store your API key securely using `userdata`.
4. **Upload your video:** Execute the code cell to upload your video file.
5. **Run the remaining cells:** These cells will process your video and send an analysis request to the Gemini model.
6. **View the results:** The output of the analysis will be displayed in the notebook.

## Example

The notebook includes an example analysis using a sample video. You can replace this with your own video to experiment with the Gemini model's capabilities.

## Notes

- Ensure that your video file is in a format supported by the Gemini API.
- You can customize the user prompt and system prompt to tailor the analysis to your specific needs.
- Refer to the Gemini API documentation for more information about the available models and their capabilities.
